##Introduction
[Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/){:target="_blank"} is a powerhouse reverse engineering suite that provides a plethora of functionality that is useful when reverse engineering malware. It has a robust Python API for interacting with abstractions (semantic representations) generated by their multiple levels of [Binary Ninja Intermediate Languages (BNILs)](https://docs.binary.ninja/dev/bnil-overview.html){:target="_blank"}. These abstractions result in large simplifications of disassembled instructions into intrinsic functions and high level languages that can be accessed directly and easily, which we will be leveraging throughout this workshop.
This workshop will use Binary Ninja to acquire information needed to deobfuscate and extract a Qakbot sample from its packed form.
