## Introduction
[Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/){:target="_blank"} is a powerhouse reverse engineering suite that provides a plethora of functionality that is useful when reverse engineering malware. It has a robust Python API for interacting with abstractions (semantic representations) generated by their multiple levels of [Binary Ninja Intermediate Languages (BNILs)](https://docs.binary.ninja/dev/bnil-overview.html){:target="_blank"}. These abstractions result in large simplifications of disassembled instructions into intrinsic functions and high level languages that can be accessed directly and easily, which we will be leveraging throughout this workshop.
This workshop will use Binary Ninja to acquire information needed to deobfuscate and extract a Qakbot sample from its packed form.
## Setup
For the Binary Ninja components of this workshop, you will need a personal, commercial or enterprise version of Binary Ninja. This will give you access to the Python API that we will be using to extract information from the Binary Ninja database.
In addition to Binary Ninja, we will be using two Python modules to extract a resource from the packed binary (https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile) and carve embedded Portable Executables (https://github.com/binref/refinery).
To add these modules in Binary Ninja, perform the following steps:
- Press CMD/CTRL+P to open the command palette and type in “Install python3 module”, which will highlight this command within the command palette window, as shown in Figure 1.
